        "However, we first need to set `enable_seqscan` to false. The details of this can be elaborated upon elsewhere, but the gist of it is that we need postgres to use the index that we created above when performing queries (like with `SELECT`). By disabling this postgres runtime variable, we make sure that postgres always uses our index, which allows us to perform vector search using lantern.\n",

        "\n",
        "Since our index was built to use the L2-squared distance (squared Euclidean distance), and so that is the distance that is used during the search below. Note that `l2sq_dist` found in the first part of the statement only recomputes the distance with the neighbors to show up in the query for our convenience! The actual search, which occurs in the second half of the SQL statement, performs search in the index which was configured to use L2-squared distance when we built it above. Hence, we see this distance being reflected in the print statements below."
